<h1 align="left"> INTERACTIVE MAP PLOT<br><i>Topic: Earthquakes</i> </h1> 

The purpose of this project is to create a user-friendly and interactive visualization tool for earthquake data provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The main goals are to help users explore earthquake data and understand the magnitude, depth, and location of seismic events. The tool can be used to educate the public and other government organizations about earthquake-related issues and support further research and analysis.

## Tools
- Leaflet.js for map rendering and interactivity
- D3.js for connecting to the USGS GeoJSON API and manipulating data
- HTML and JavaScript for structuring and coding the web application

## Features
- Interactive map 
- Real-time data from USGS GeoJSON Feed
- Data markers reflecting earthquake magnitude and depth
- Popups with additional information about each earthquake
- Legend providing context for map data
